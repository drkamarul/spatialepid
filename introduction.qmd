# Example of a simple calculation in R
relative_risk <- function(a, b, c, d) {
  # a: exposed cases
  # b: exposed non-cases
  # c: unexposed cases
  # d: unexposed non-cases
  
  risk_exposed <- a / (a + b)
  risk_unexposed <- c / (c + d)
  
  return(risk_exposed / risk_unexposed)
}

# Example usage
relative_risk(15, 85, 5, 95)
